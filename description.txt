This is implementation of Gomoku game by me. Two players should play the game. In order to run the program you need to install Tkinter interface. The installation steps are available in the following link "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-tkinter-in-windows/".
Run the "Interface.py" file.
